/** the core of this solution, we have an abstract TrainerBase class. 
This class is in the Common folder and its main goal is to standardize the way this whole process is done. 
It is in this class where we process data and perform feature engineering. 
This class is also in charge of training machine learning algorithm. 
The classes that implement this abstract class are located in the Trainers folder. 
Here we can find multiple classes which utilize ML.NET algorithms. 
These classes define which algorithm should be used. In this particular case, we have only one Predictor located in the Predictor folder.**/
